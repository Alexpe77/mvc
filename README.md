# MVC exercise

This repo is an exercise to learn how to use the MVC structure. </br>
I used the starter pack provided by Be Code in which was already all the necessary files. </br>
The homepage from the starter pack works and provides a link to the articles page. </br>
My job here was to provide a detail page to show all content from an article so of course I had to create a database so I uses MySQL with a PDO connection. </br>

## Technology used
HTML, PHP, MySQL
